== // equality 
!= // not equal 
=== // strict equality 
!== // strict non equality 

// == vs ===
// == (double equals) checks for equality of value, but not equality of type
// It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them
// This can lead to some unexpected results

// === (triple equals) checks for equality of value AND type
// ALWAYS GO WITH TRIPLE EQUALS
// ALSO ALWAYS GO WITH !==
